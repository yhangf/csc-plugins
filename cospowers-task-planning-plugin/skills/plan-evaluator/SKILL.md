# Plan Evaluator

## Skill 标识

- Skill name: `plan-evaluator`
- Plugin: `cospowers-task-planning`
- Scope: Independent split plugin package `cospowers-task-planning-plugin`
- Entry skill: `task-planning`

**Skill 标识**: `plan-evaluator`

Other skills refer to this skill by `plan-evaluator`.

## Extension Points

Before starting, read `cospowers.config.json` from the plugin root. Use it only for local task-planning plugin defaults and optional extension points; do not require other split plugins to be installed.

| Config field | Used for |
|---|---|
| `config.templates["implementation-plan"]` | Implementation plan template path — used to compare local plan structure expectations |
| `config.templates["task-graph"]` | Task graph template path — used when plan traceability references generated task graphs |
| `config.templates["execution-strategy"]` | Execution strategy template path — used when reviewing handoff and execution-mode recommendations |
| `config["domain-skills"]` | Optional extension domain skills surfaced by `writing-plans` |

## Overview

Evaluate implementation plans produced by `writing-plans` using **item-by-item check scanning** (one check item at a time, with real-time output), **weighted scoring**, and a **detailed issue report** that pinpoints exactly what is wrong, where, and why.

This skill is **mode-adaptive**: it detects the plan's source path (Subsystem / System / Innovation) and adjusts check scope, red lines, and scoring weights accordingly.

**Evaluation order (never skip or reorder):**

```
Phase 0: Load (mode detection → load plan → load upstream docs by mode)
  → Phase 1: Item-by-item scan (5 layers, mode-adaptive)
  → Phase 1.3: Scan completion statistics
  → Phase 1.4: Red line checks (mode-dependent)
  → Phase 3: Scoring (mode-adaptive weights)
  → Phase 4: Report generation
```

> Phase 2 is skipped — this split plugin evaluates plan-to-upstream traceability only. Cross-document design consistency remains outside the task-planning plugin boundary.

## ⚠️ Five Hard Constraints (Must Follow 100%)

### 1. Item-by-Item Scanning: Every check item must be independently checked ⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ **MUST**: For each check item, output "📍 Check [CHECK-ID]: [description]", then execute, then output conclusion
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Batch-skipping multiple items or outputting "overall compliant" without per-item checking
- ✅ **MUST**: When violations found, record document location, quote original text, cite violated rule
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Reporting vague descriptions like "plan is not detailed enough" without specific locations

### 2. Mode-Adaptive Constraint: Check scope must match detected mode ⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ **MUST**: Detect mode first (Phase 0.1), then apply the correct check layer and scoring weights
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Applying Subsystem-mode checks to an Innovation-mode plan (e.g., checking REQ coverage when no REQs exist)
- ✅ **MUST**: Skip Layer 2 (TRC) entirely in Innovation mode

### 3. Scoring Constraint: Scores must have justification ⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ **MUST**: Each dimension score accompanied by deduction detail (which item deducted how much)
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Giving scores without explaining deductions
- ✅ **MUST**: Red line violation → total grade F regardless of other scores

### 4. Only Report Real Problems: Passed items are NOT written to report ⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ **MUST**: Only report items that actually violate rules or have issues
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Writing "compliant, keep it up" for passed items
- ✅ **MUST**: Each issue has: location + quote + violated rule + severity + fix suggestion

### 5. Find-One-Scan-All: One class of problem found → scan entire document for same class ⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ **MUST**: Upon finding one instance of a problem class (e.g., placeholder text), immediately scan the full document for all other instances
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Recording only the first found instance while missing others of the same class

## Phase 0: Load

### 0.1 Mode Detection

**Detect the plan's source path before loading anything else.** The mode determines which check layers are active.

```
1. Check whether the plan path is a parent index under docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<project>/index.md or references per-service plans
   → YES: Subsystem Mode (service-split implementation plan)
2. Check whether docs/design/subsystem-* documents or a dated subsystem design directory exist
   → YES: Subsystem Mode (subsystem design handoff available)
3. Check whether docs/design/system-design.md or an explicitly provided system design handoff exists
   → YES: System Mode (system-level design handoff available)
4. None of the above
   → Innovation Mode (standalone plan, no upstream design docs)
```

Output the detected mode:

```
📂 Mode detected: [Subsystem / System / Innovation]
   Active layers: [Layer 1-5 (full) / Layer 1,3,4,5 + Layer 2 (reduced) / Layer 1,3,4,5 only]
   Red lines active: [R1,R2,R3 / R1,R2,R3 / R2,R3]
```

### 0.2 Load the Plan Document

Read the plan file at the path provided in the dispatch prompt (`[PLAN_PATH]`). Identify its structure:
- Header block (Goal, Architecture, Tech Stack)
- Conventions block
- Domain Skills block
- Task blocks (each with Files, Test Cases, checkbox steps)

If the plan is a parent `index.md` (Subsystem mode, multi-service), load each per-service plan file listed in the index.

### 0.3 Load Upstream Documents (by Mode)

**Subsystem Mode** — Load all available local handoff artifacts:
- Requirements: if provided, read the user-supplied requirements document or `docs/requirements/` files and extract REQ identifiers
- System design: read `docs/design/system-design.md` and related design handoff files when present; extract DFX targets and major design decisions
- Subsystem design: read subsystem documents under `docs/design/` (for example `subsystem-*-design.md` or a dated subsystem directory); extract interfaces, exception scenarios, DFX targets, dependencies, and data model sections when present
- OpenAPI spec: read `docs/design/openapi.yaml` or another OpenAPI handoff path explicitly provided by the user

**System Mode** — Load available local handoff artifacts:
- Requirements: if provided, read the user-supplied requirements document or `docs/requirements/` files and extract REQ identifiers
- System design: read `docs/design/system-design.md` and related design handoff files; extract DFX targets and major design decisions
- OpenAPI spec: read `docs/design/openapi.yaml` or another OpenAPI handoff path explicitly provided by the user

**Innovation Mode** — Skip upstream document loading. Only the plan itself is evaluated.

Output:
```
✅ Upstream documents loaded
   Mode: [Subsystem/System/Innovation]
   REQ items to trace: [N] (or N/A)
   API endpoints to trace: [N] (or N/A)
   DFX dimensions to verify: [N] (or N/A)
```

## Phase 1: Item-by-Item Scan

Each check item is scanned independently with the fixed format below.

### 1.1 Scan Output Format

For each check item, output:

```
📍 Check [CHECK-ID]: [description]
  ├─ Location: [plan section or "full plan"]
  ├─ Quote: "[exact text from plan, or N/A if looking for absence]"
  ├─ Requirement: [what the rule requires]
  ├─ Result: ✅ Pass / ❌ Violation / ⚠️ Warning / ⬜ Not Applicable (mode)
  └─ [violation only] Issue ID: [ISSUE-XXX] | Level: [Critical/Error/Warning] | Deduction: [-N] | Dimension: [name]
```

### 1.2 Violation Record Format

```
[ISSUE-XXX]
  Document: [plan file name]
  Location: [Task N / Header / Conventions block]
  Rule: [CHECK-ID] — [rule description]
  Quote: "[exact text from plan]"
  Description: [specifically what violates the rule]
  Severity: Critical / Error / Warning
  Fix Direction: [actionable fix suggestion]
  Deduction: [-N points] (Dimension: [name])
```

### Check Item Layers

#### Layer 1: Structure Completeness (PLAN-STR, 7 items)

Active in ALL modes.

| ID | Check Item | Location | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| PLAN-STR-01 | Header completeness: Goal (1 sentence), Architecture (2-3 sentences), Tech Stack listed — all non-empty, non-generic | Plan header | Error |
| PLAN-STR-02 | Conventions block: language, naming, imports, error handling, testing, logging, API patterns, DB, config, docstring — all documented with actual conventions learned from codebase | Conventions block | Error |
| PLAN-STR-03 | Conventions source credibility: declares it was learned from actual codebase files (lists sampled files), not invented | Conventions block | Warning |
| PLAN-STR-04 | Domain Skills block: all 4 categories present (单测编写, 测试方法, 排障调试, 代码编写). Missing categories explicitly marked "None — use default approach" | Domain Skills block | Warning |
| PLAN-STR-05 | Each task has Files section: Create/Modify/Test columns with exact paths. Modify paths correspond to existing files (verify with Glob) | Each task | Error |
| PLAN-STR-06 | Each task has Test Cases table section BEFORE checkbox steps | Each task | Critical |
| PLAN-STR-07 | Subsystem mode only: parent index.md exists, lists all service plan files, code status (existing/new) annotated. Skip in System/Innovation modes | Plan index | Error |

#### Layer 2: Upstream Information Fidelity (PLAN-TRC, 9 items)

**Subsystem Mode**: All 9 items active.
**System Mode**: TRC-01, TRC-02, TRC-03, TRC-05, TRC-08, TRC-09 active. TRC-04, TRC-06, TRC-07 skipped (⬜ N/A — no subsystem docs).
**Innovation Mode**: Entire layer skipped (⬜ N/A — no upstream docs).

| ID | Check Item | Location | Severity | Mode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PLAN-TRC-01 | REQ full coverage: every REQ-XXX in system requirements ch03 maps to at least one task | Cross-reference: sysreq ch03 ↔ plan tasks | Critical | Sub, Sys |
| PLAN-TRC-02 | API full coverage: every endpoint in OpenAPI spec owned by this subsystem maps to at least one task | Cross-reference: OpenAPI paths ↔ plan tasks | Critical | Sub, Sys |
| PLAN-TRC-03 | DFX implementation: each DFX dimension (security/reliability/performance/operability/testability/scalability) from design doc §7 or §5 has a corresponding implementation task, or explicit "not in this iteration" notation | Cross-reference: design DFX ↔ plan tasks | Error | Sub, Sys |
| PLAN-TRC-04 | Exception handling coverage: each exception scenario in subsystem design §5 maps to at least one task test case (exception/boundary type) | Cross-reference: subsys §5 ↔ plan Test Cases | Error | Sub |
| PLAN-TRC-05 | Design decisions preserved: key design decisions (approach selection, architecture constraints) from design docs reflected in plan Architecture section or relevant tasks | Cross-reference: design §4.1 ↔ plan | Error | Sub, Sys |
| PLAN-TRC-06 | External dependency handling: each DEP-XXX in subsystem design §3.5 has a handling strategy in plan (mock/stub/integration test) | Cross-reference: subsys §3.5 ↔ plan | Warning | Sub |
| PLAN-TRC-07 | Data model coverage: each database table in subsystem design §4.4.1 maps to at least one task (migration/DAO/model) | Cross-reference: subsys §4.4.1 ↔ plan tasks | Error | Sub |
| PLAN-TRC-08 | Task source annotation: each task explicitly references its source (REQ-XXX / design §X.X / API path), traceability chain auditable | Each task header/description | Warning | Sub, Sys |
| PLAN-TRC-09 | API path accuracy: API endpoints referenced in tasks (method + path) match the OpenAPI spec exactly, no invented paths | Cross-reference: plan tasks ↔ OpenAPI | Error | Sub, Sys |

#### Layer 3: No Placeholders + Executability (PLAN-EXE, 10 items)

Active in ALL modes.

| ID | Check Item | Location | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| PLAN-EXE-01 | No TBD / TODO / "implement later" / "fill in details" anywhere in plan | Full plan | Critical |
| PLAN-EXE-02 | No vague "Add appropriate error handling" / "add validation" / "handle edge cases" without specifics (must state which error, how to handle) | Full plan | Error |
| PLAN-EXE-03 | No "Write tests for the above" without actual test code and assertions | Full plan | Error |
| PLAN-EXE-04 | No "Similar to Task N" references — each task is self-contained | Full plan | Error |
| PLAN-EXE-05 | Every code step includes actual code blocks (```language ... ```), not just text descriptions | Each task checkbox step | Error |
| PLAN-EXE-06 | All referenced types/functions/methods are defined in this task or a prior task — no orphan references | Cross-reference within plan | Error |
| PLAN-EXE-07 | File paths are exact and verifiable: create paths in reasonable directories, modify paths correspond to existing files (Glob verify) | Each task Files section | Error |
| PLAN-EXE-08 | Each Test Case row complete: TC-ID, source trace, type, preconditions/input, expected assertions (concrete assert statements), automation level, test target path, run command | Each task Test Cases table | Error |
| PLAN-EXE-09 | No weak assertions: no "verify it works", "assert result is not None", "assert True" — assertions must verify specific behavior | Each task Test Cases table | Error |
| PLAN-EXE-10 | Test commands match conventions: each test case run command uses the test framework declared in Conventions block (pytest / go test / jest), target file/function paths correct | Each task Test Cases table | Warning |

#### Layer 4: Cross-Task Consistency + Standards (PLAN-CNS, 7 items)

Active in ALL modes. (CNS-05 is N/A in System and Innovation modes — no cross-service plans exist.)

| ID | Check Item | Location | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| PLAN-CNS-01 | Type/function name consistency: same function/type/variable referenced consistently across tasks (e.g., not `clearLayers()` in Task 3 but `clearFullLayers()` in Task 7) | Cross-reference across tasks | Error |
| PLAN-CNS-02 | Code style consistency: all code examples follow conventions declared in Conventions block (naming, imports, error handling, logging) | Full plan code blocks | Error |
| PLAN-CNS-03 | Commit message format: follows conventional commits (feat/fix/test/chore/etc.) | Each task commit step | Warning |
| PLAN-CNS-04 | Test case scenario coverage: each task's test cases cover normal + boundary + exception scenario types. Missing one type is a defect | Each task Test Cases table | Error |
| PLAN-CNS-05 | Integration test tasks: multi-service plans include end-to-end integration verification tasks covering cross-service call chains | Plan task list (Subsystem mode) | Warning |
| PLAN-CNS-06 | Task ordering: dependent tasks ordered correctly (dependency before dependent). Tasks that produce types used by later tasks must come first | Plan task list | Warning |
| PLAN-CNS-07 | Domain Skill usage: skills listed in Domain Skills block have corresponding inline references (`> **调用 \`skill-name\`** ...`) in task steps where applicable | Each task checkbox step | Warning |

#### Layer 5: TDD Completeness (PLAN-TDD, 5 items)

Active in ALL modes.

| ID | Check Item | Location | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| PLAN-TDD-01 | RED phase complete: each task's steps 1-2 are "write failing test" + "run test, verify it fails for the expected reason (feature not implemented, not syntax error)" | Each task steps 1-2 | Error |
| PLAN-TDD-02 | GREEN phase complete: each task has minimal implementation step that makes the corresponding test pass, implementation code matches test scope | Each task implementation step | Error |
| PLAN-TDD-03 | REFACTOR phase: complex tasks (algorithms, data structures, multi-branch logic) have a refactor step. Simple CRUD tasks may omit | Each task (complex tasks only) | Warning |
| PLAN-TDD-04 | Test case traceability: each TC-ID traces to a specific upstream design location (design §X.X / REQ-XXX / API endpoint), source column is not empty | Each task Test Cases table | Warning |
| PLAN-TDD-05 | Test isolation: unit tests do not depend on external services (DB/network/filesystem). External dependencies explicitly annotated with mock/fixture strategy in test case preconditions | Each task Test Cases table | Error |

### 1.3 Scan Completion Statistics

After all 38 check items across all active layers are scanned, output a completion summary before proceeding to red line checks:

```
📊 [plan file name] scan complete
  - Total items scanned: [N] (mode-adapted, skipped items counted as N/A)
  - Pass: [n]
  - Violations (Critical): [n]
  - Violations (Error): [n]
  - Warnings: [n]
  - Issues found: [ISSUE-001 through ISSUE-XXX]
  - Layer breakdown:
    Layer 1 STR: [passed]/[total] | Layer 2 TRC: [passed]/[total] | Layer 3 EXE: [passed]/[total]
    Layer 4 CNS: [passed]/[total] | Layer 5 TDD: [passed]/[total]
```

### 1.4 Red Line Checks (Mode-Dependent, One-Vote Veto to F)

These MUST be checked early. Any violation → total grade F regardless of other scores.

**R1 — REQ Coverage Gap** (Subsystem and System modes only. Innovation mode: ⬜ N/A)

A single REQ-XXX in system requirements ch03 has zero corresponding tasks in the plan → R1 violated.

```
🚨 R1 REQ Coverage: ❌ VIOLATED
   Uncovered REQs: REQ-003, REQ-007, REQ-012
   Total uncovered: 3 / 15 REQ items
```

**R2 — Placeholder Contamination** (All modes)

Any TBD / TODO / "implement later" / "fill in details" found in plan → R2 violated.

```
🚨 R2 Placeholder: ❌ VIOLATED
   Found instances:
   - Task 3 step 4: "TODO: add error handling"
   - Task 5 Test Cases: "TBD"
   Total instances: 2
```

**R3 — Test Case Section Missing** (All modes)

Any task lacks a Test Cases section before checkbox steps → R3 violated.

```
🚨 R3 Test Case Missing: ❌ VIOLATED
   Tasks without Test Cases: Task 4, Task 7
   Total: 2 / 8 tasks
```

Red line output format:

```
🚨 Red Line Check Results:
  R1 REQ Coverage: ✅ Pass / ❌ Violated — [details]
  R2 Placeholder:  ✅ Pass / ❌ Violated — [details]
  R3 Test Case:    ✅ Pass / ❌ Violated — [details]
```

## Phase 2: Cross-Document Consistency

> **Skipped in this skill.** Cross-document consistency for requirements and design artifacts is outside this split plugin's scope. This skill's Layer 2 (TRC) checks plan-to-upstream traceability, which is a different concern.

## Phase 3: Scoring

### 3.1 Scoring Dimensions and Weights (Mode-Adaptive)

**Subsystem Mode:**

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Upstream Information Fidelity** | 30% | REQ/API/DFX/exception/data model coverage — is the plan carrying ALL information from upstream design docs? |
| **Executability & Precision** | 25% | No placeholders, exact paths, concrete code, specific test commands — can an engineer execute this without asking questions? |
| **TDD Completeness** | 20% | RED/GREEN/REFACTOR cycle complete per task, test isolation, test traceability |
| **Cross-Task Consistency & Standards** | 15% | Type consistency, code style, task ordering, scenario coverage |
| **Structure Compliance** | 10% | Header, conventions, domain skills, task structure completeness |

**System Mode:**

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Upstream Information Fidelity** | 25% | REQ/API/DFX/design decisions covered (reduced scope — no subsystem docs) |
| **Executability & Precision** | 30% | (increased — more weight on self-contained plan quality) |
| **TDD Completeness** | 20% | |
| **Cross-Task Consistency & Standards** | 15% | |
| **Structure Compliance** | 10% | |

**Innovation Mode:**

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Upstream Information Fidelity** | 0% | Skipped — no upstream docs exist |
| **Executability & Precision** | 40% | (maximum weight — plan is the sole artifact) |
| **TDD Completeness** | 30% | |
| **Cross-Task Consistency & Standards** | 20% | |
| **Structure Compliance** | 10% | |

### 3.2 Per-Dimension Deduction Rules

Each dimension starts at 100 points. Deductions by severity:

| Severity | Deduction per Issue |
|---|---|
| **Critical** | -40 points |
| **Error** | -20 points |
| **Warning** | -8 points |

Each dimension floors at 0 (no negative scores).

**Impact examples:**
- 1 Critical → dimension drops to 60 or below (D zone)
- 2 Errors → dimension drops to 60 (D zone)
- 3 Warnings → dimension loses 24 points

### 3.3 Total Score Calculation

```
Total = UpstreamFidelity×W1 + Executability×W2 + TDD×W3 + Consistency×W4 + Structure×W5
```

Where W1-W5 are the mode-adaptive weights from §3.1. In Innovation mode, UpstreamFidelity is skipped and its weight redistributed.

| Total Score | Grade | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 95-100 | **A** | Excellent — ready for execution handoff |
| 80-94 | **B** | Good — ready for execution handoff |
| 65-79 | **C** | Marginal — must fix all Error + Critical issues and re-evaluate |
| <65 | **D** | Failing — major rework needed, re-evaluate after fixes |
| Red line violation | **F** | Immediate failure, regardless of other scores |

### 3.4 Scoring Output Format

## Phase 4: Report Generation

Save structured Markdown report to a `quality-reports/` subdirectory next to the plan file. If the plan is a parent `index.md`, save alongside it. File name: `YYYY-MM-DD-plan-quality-report.md`.

### Report Structure

```markdown

## III. Issue List (by Severity)

### 🚨 Critical

[ISSUE-XXX details: document/location/rule/quote/description/fix direction]

### ❌ Error

[...]

### ⚠️ Warning

[...]

---

## IV. Improvement Suggestions (Prioritized)

1. **[Highest]** [Fix Critical issues — specific steps]
2. **[High]** [Fix Error issues — specific steps]
3. **[Medium]** [Fix Warning issues — suggestions]
4. **[Coverage]** [Add missing task coverage for uncovered REQs/APIs/DFX dimensions]

---

## V. Next Steps

- Grade A/B (≥ 80) → Plan is ready for downstream handoff to `tdd-implementation` or another execution environment
- Grade C (65–79) → Fix all Error+ issues, re-dispatch `plan-evaluator` (max 2 repair rounds)
- Grade D (< 65) or F → Major rework needed. Fix root issues, re-dispatch `plan-evaluator`
- After 2 repair rounds still < B → Present remaining issues to user, request manual intervention
```

## Integration

`plan-evaluator` is a **passive evaluator** — it does not route to the next step.

- Dispatched by `writing-plans` after the plan is written (before Execution Handoff)
- Runs as an isolated subagent via `skills/plan-evaluator/agents/evaluator-dispatch-prompt.md`
- Returns to `writing-plans`: grade (A/B/C/D/F), score, red line status, Critical + Error issues table, report path
- `writing-plans` decides next action based on grade:
  - A/B (≥ 80): Add the report path to the downstream handoff block
  - C/D/F: Fix issues, re-dispatch (max 2 repair rounds, then escalate to user)
- Report path: same directory as plan file, `quality-reports/YYYY-MM-DD-plan-quality-report.md`
